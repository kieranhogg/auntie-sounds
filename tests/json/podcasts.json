Those fascinated by the lives of kings and queens can journey to Versailles to meet Marie Antoinette and Louis XIV the Sun King, or to Ancient Egypt to meet Cleopatra and Nerfertiti. Or perhaps you’re looking to explore the history of religion, from Buddhism’s early teachings to the Protestant Reformation.\n \nIf you’re interested in the stories behind iconic works of art, music and literature, dive in to discussions on the artistic genius of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and Van Gogh’s famous Sunflowers. From Gothic architecture to the works of Shakespeare, each episode of In Our Time offers new insight into humanity’s cultural achievements.\n \nThose looking to enrich their scientific knowledge can hear episodes on black holes, the Periodic Table, and classical theories of gravity, motion, evolution and relativity. Learn how the discovery of penicillin revolutionised medicine, and how the death of stars can lead to the formation of new planets. \n \nLovers of philosophy will find episodes on the big issues that define existence, from free will and ethics, to liberty and justice. In what ways did celebrated philosophers such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Karl Marx push forward radical new ideas? How has the concept of karma evolved from the ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism to today? What was Plato’s concept of an ideal republic, and how did he explore this through the legend of the lost city of Atlantis?\n \nIn Our Time celebrates the pursuit of knowledge and the enduring power of ideas."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m1q0kc.jpg","activities":[],"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"playable_count":null,"recommendation":null},{"type":"container_item","id":"m0010x7c","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:m0010x7c","tlec_urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:m0010x7c","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.9.4/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"titles":{"primary":"Uncanny","secondary":null,"tertiary":null},"synopses":{"short":"Danny Robins investigates compelling real-life stories of the paranormal.","medium":"From ghostly phantoms to UFOs, Danny Robins investigates real-life stories of paranormal encounters.

Her mother Christine Flack tells Clare McDonnell about spending the past five years uncovering documents from the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service to try to find out more about the events around Caroline’s death and she also questions the role of the press.

It is often mild but can sometimes be debilitating and it's been highlighted by a BBC news report that has come out today.

With over a thousand episodes to choose from, he has selected just six that capture the huge range and depth of the subjects he and his experts have tackled. In this sixth of his choices, we hear Melvyn Bragg and his guests in 2017 discussing new discoveries about dinosaurs. Their topic is the development of theories about dinosaur feathers, following discoveries of fossils which show evidence of those feathers. All dinosaurs were originally thought to be related to lizards (the word 'dinosaur' was created from the Greek for 'terrible lizard') but that now appears false. In the last century, discoveries of fossils with feathers established that at least some dinosaurs were feathered and that some of those survived the great extinctions and evolved into the birds we see today. There are still many outstanding areas for study, such as what sorts of feathers they were, where on the body they were found, what their purpose was and which dinosaurs had them.

From Gothic architecture to the works of Shakespeare, each episode of In Our Time offers new insight into humanity’s cultural achievements.\n \nThose looking to enrich their scientific knowledge can hear episodes on black holes, the Periodic Table, and classical theories of gravity, motion, evolution and relativity. Learn how the discovery of penicillin revolutionised medicine, and how the death of stars can lead to the formation of new planets. \n \nLovers of philosophy will find episodes on the big issues that define existence, from free will and ethics, to liberty and justice. In what ways did celebrated philosophers such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Karl Marx push forward radical new ideas? How has the concept of karma evolved from the ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism to today? What was Plato’s concept of an ideal republic, and how did he explore this through the legend of the lost city of Atlantis?\n \nIn Our Time celebrates the pursuit of knowledge and the enduring power of ideas."},"activities":[]},"download":{"type":"drm","quality_variants":{"low":{"bitrate":96,"file_url":null,"file_size":40000000,"label":"40 MB"},"medium":{"bitrate":128,"file_url":null,"file_size":53000000,"label":"53 MB"},"high":{"bitrate":320,"file_url":null,"file_size":130000000,"label":"130 MB"}}},"availability":{"from":"2025-11-13T09:45:00Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"release":{"date":"2025-11-13T00:00:00Z","label":"13 Nov 2025"},"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"activities":[],"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qykl&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"play_context":null,"recommendation":null},{"type":"playable_item","id":"p0mg1vzl","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:p0mg1vjb","network":{"id":"bbc_sounds_podcasts","key":"podcasts","short_title":"Sounds","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.9.4/networks/bbc_sounds_podcasts/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"titles":{"primary":"Evil Genius with Russell Kane","secondary":"Serge Gainsbourg","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"Serge Gainsbourg"},"synopses":{"short":"Catherine Bohart, Ria Lina and Pierre Novellie look back on the trésor national.","medium":"Catherine Bohart, Ria Lina and Pierre Novellie look back on the trésor national.","long":"Was Serge Gainsbourg a cultural French icon, who pushed the boundaries of music and inspired generations of musicians?

According to the traditional narrative, when the Mughals began to decline in the 18th century, the subcontinent descended into political chaos, and European trading powers – most notably the British East India Company – swooped in to take advantage and (in their words) restore order. But can we trust this story?\n\nIn this episode, we look at India’s long 18th century not as a period of chaos, but one of dynamic transformation and exciting developments.

He’s a prominent climate scientist and Chair in Mathematical Modelling of the Climate System at Exeter University. His models have transformed our understanding of climate change, revealing a complex dynamical system with carbon at its centre, cycling between the atmosphere, oceans and land, to directly influence the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nPierre is actively involved in assessing the state of our climate through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and, as director of the Global Carbon Budget, estimates the remaining amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted before we breach our global climate targets. It’s the ultimate test of effective climate action and the latest annual update will be released at COP. \n\nPierre explains how we can all play our part to reduce carbon emissions, and he practises what he preaches - he won’t be flying to COP this year so as to minimise his own carbon footprint.\n\nPresented by Jim Al-Khalili\nProduced by Beth Eastwood\nExecutive Producer: Alexandra Feachem\nA BBC Studios Production"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m1wsx5.jpg","duration":{"value":1690,"label":"28 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"series","id":"b015sqc7","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:series:b015sqc7","title":"The Life Scientific","synopses":{"short":"Professor Jim Al-Khalili talks to leading scientists about their life and work.","medium":"Professor Jim Al-Khalili talks to leading scientists about their life and work, finding out what inspires them and asking what their discoveries might do for us in the future.","long":"Professor Jim Al-Khalili talks to leading scientists about their life and work, finding out what inspires and motivates them and asking what their discoveries might do for us in the future"},"activities":[]},"download":{"type":"drm","quality_variants":{"low":{"bitrate":96,"file_url":null,"file_size":24000000,"label":"24 MB"},"medium":{"bitrate":128,"file_url":null,"file_size":31000000,"label":"31 MB"},"high":{"bitrate":320,"file_url":null,"file_size":76000000,"label":"76 MB"}}},"availability":{"from":"2025-11-11T09:30:00Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"release":{"date":"2025-11-11T00:00:00Z","label":"11 Nov 2025"},"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"activities":[],"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b015sqc7&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"play_context":null,"recommendation":null},{"type":"playable_item","id":"p0mdww29","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:m002m0c8","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.9.4/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"titles":{"primary":"Child","secondary":"Series 2","tertiary":"2.

Dorothy Atkinson reads.\n\nRose George reminds us that Samuel Coleridge thought of fish as nothing more than ‘slimy things’ in the water.  In her new book she observes that today, we see fish mostly as food, and she invites us to reconsider, to think beyond our dinner plates and to go out and wonder at this glorious species and the oceans they inhabit. As our appetites for fish grow and the health benefits of these watery dwellers are widely disseminated, George asks where our lunches, pet food, supplements and garden fertilizers in the shape of fishmeal are going to come through. As fish stocks continue to diminish and artisanal fishing practices are dwindling George asks hard questions. We'll hear about the impact of over fishing;  the plight of the Senegalese fishing industry; the question of fish farms, and also  a celebration of fishwives, along with stories of the heroic fisherman who saved lives during the world wars and continue do so on our most perilous seas.\n\nDorothy Atkinson is the reader. She is acclaimed for her work in theatre, film and television. She has appeared in several films by Mike Leigh most notably Mr Turner. She is well known for playing Pauline in the sitcom Mum. Recent work includes Ludwig, Joan, Saltburn, Without Sin, Pennyworth, Harlots and Call the Midwife.\n\nRose George is the author of A Life Removed: Hunting for Refuge in the Modern World (long-listed for the Ulysses Reportage Prize), The Big Necessity: Adventures in the World of Human Waste (Portobello, 2008; shortlisted for the BMA Book Prize) and Deep Sea and Foreign Going: Inside Shipping, the Invisible Industry that Brings You 90% of Everything (Portobello, 2013; winner of a Mountbatten Maritime Award), and Nine Pints: A Journey Through the Mysterious, Miraculous World of Blood (Portobello, 2018).\n\nRose writes frequently for the Guardian, New Statesman and many other publications, and her two TED talks, on sanitation and seafaring, have had 3 million views.\n\nAbridger: Katrin Williams\nProducer: Elizabeth Allard"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m98rm4.jpg","duration":{"value":840,"label":"14 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"series","id":"m002ld5b","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:series:m002ld5b","title":"Every Last Fish by Rose George","synopses":{"short":"Take a deep dive with Rose George as she explores the complex and slippery world of fish.","medium":"Book of the Week.

They explore the flaws and future of accurate astronomical and atomic timekeeping, and Marcus blames the ‘leap second’ for his fry-up failures.\n\nProducer: Olivia Jani\nSeries Producer: Melanie Brown\nExecutive Producer: Alexandra Feachem\nA BBC Studios Production"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m1q7ly.jpg","duration":{"value":2538,"label":"42 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b00snr0w","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b00snr0w","title":"The Infinite Monkey Cage","synopses":{"short":"Brian Cox and Robin Ince host an irreverent look at the world through scientists' eyes.","medium":"Brian Cox and Robin Ince host a witty, irreverent look at the world through scientists' eyes.","long":"Professor Brian Cox and Robin Ince host a witty, irreverent look at the world through scientists’ eyes.

According to the traditional narrative, when the Mughals began to decline in the 18th century, the subcontinent descended into political chaos, and European trading powers – most notably the British East India Company – swooped in to take advantage and (in their words) restore order. But can we trust this story?\n\nIn this episode, we look at India’s long 18th century not as a period of chaos, but one of dynamic transformation and exciting developments. Taking in the rise of new powers including the Marathas, the Rajputs and the Sikh Empire, and looking at changes in the economy, global trade, artistic patronage and gender relations, we explore what India was really like at this time.\n\nThis is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

In each episode of You’re Dead to Me from BBC Radio 4, Greg Jenner is joined by a comedian and an expert historian to learn and laugh about the past.\n\nHistory isn’t just about dates and textbooks – it’s about extraordinary characters, amazing stories, and some very questionable fashion choices. How long did it take to build an Egyptian pyramid? What does the Bayeux Tapestry reveal about medieval life? Why did it take nearly half a millennium for Joan of Arc to become a saint? And was Catherine the Great really all that great? Whether you want to explore ancient landmarks like Stonehenge and Machu Picchu, dance through the history of Broadway and Bollywood, or find out how the Tudors rose to power, Greg and his guests promise to teach you something new that you won’t have heard in history lessons.\n\nPrevious episodes of You’re Dead To Me have covered everything from royals to revolutionaries, actors to activists and divas to dictators. Take a stroll through the history of high-heeled shoes or get the scoop on the history of ice cream. Maybe you’d like to paint like the cave artists of the Palaeolithic era, work out like a Victorian bodybuilder, or fight like a Spartan? We’ve even hosted a special, live episode with the BBC Concert Orchestra to explore the dramatic life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nWhatever your historical interests, Greg and his guests make even the trickiest topics easy to follow.
