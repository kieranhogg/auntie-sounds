                        "long": "What if reimagining how cities are designed could make women safer? In Cairo, sexual harassment and violence against women on the streets has been endemic. Women don't feel safe enough to walk or take public transport. A pioneering programme called Safer Cities, is hoping to find the solution through radical urban redesigns, women friendly spaces and raising awareness about sexual harassment. \n\nSalma El-Wardany, who was born in Cairo, visits a women’s only park in Imbaba, Giza and meets Samaha who runs the park. She not only oversees the children playing, but also organises events for local women with advice and support.\n\nSalma visits Zenein Market in Giza, which was resigned to better support the majority of female sellers there. They show Salma the older part of the market which is yet to be regenerated.\n\nSalma also speaks to Caroline Nassif, who worked as Project Officer at UN Women, as well as local NGOs, and Minister Manal Awad Mikhail who was one of the driving forces behind the scheme across locations. Has Cairo become a safer place for women?"

The story goes it was linked to the theft of a stash of drugs - or because the Lyons were encroaching on Daniel territory. Whatever the cause, the dispute exploded into a series of astonishingly violent tit for tat attacks which have cast a dark shadow over the city of Glasgow. The most high profile - the very public assassination of Daniel's enforcer Kevin \"Gerbil\" Carroll. He was shot dead in a hail of bullets in front of terrified shoppers in an Asda carpark in 2010.\n\nDelving into Glasgow's gangland past and it's history of violent crime, the series hears from former gangsters, ordinary members of the public caught up in this vicious turf war and the police officers fighting to take down the mobsters.\n\nMany of those at the heart of the violence are now locked up in prison - or dead. But the fear is that this is a feud which is so ingrained it could go on for generations to come.\n\nPresenter Livvy Haydock\nSeries producer: Paul Grant\nProducer: Patrick Kiteley\nJournalism assistant: Tim Fernley\nEditor and executive producer: Carl Johnston"

Why has this been sanctioned, and could the move foreshadow a pardon from the president? \n\nAnd how can Trump fire the head of one of America’s most important economic institutions because he didn’t like the latest job statistics? ?\n\nFrom South Park censorship to jeans and submarines, Matt Chorley, Justin and Marianna answer your questions on 5 Live.\n\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\npresenter\n• Matt Chorley, 5 Live presenter \n\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\n\nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

He wrote and performed in medical revues during this time and comedy became his true passion.  In 1990 he made the decision to follow his heart and leave medicine to try his luck as a stand-up.\n\nIn 1993 Harry got his first show on BBC Radio 4 – Harry Hill’s Fruit Corner.  Four years later he starred in his own television series on Channel 4 which allowed him to channel his off-the-wall humour in a series of wildly unpredictable comedy sketches.\n\nIn 2001 he started writing and presenting Harry Hill’s TV Burp on ITV  which looked back at the week’s television output in a series of comedy sketches and inventive parodies.  The show won three BAFTAs, three Royal Television Society awards, a Rose d’Or and Seven British Comedy Awards.\n\nHarry lives in London with his wife Magda.

Who are the heroes we need today?\n\nWith the help of leading historians, psychologists, philosophers and theologians, he examines how heroism is continually questioned and re-invented in every age, and how these contrasting visions of the hero might speak to us in our own time. What does it mean for our moral life? How should we perceive and pursue human excellence?\n\nIn this episode, Rory explores ideas of the hero from the classical world to the middle ages.\n\nPresenter: Rory Stewart\nProducer and sound design: Dan Tierney\nEditor: Tim Pemberton\nCommissioning Editor: Dan Clarke"

These days the kids call it 'Indie Sleaze', although at the time there was no cohesive name for the collection of bands - from Franz Ferdinand to The Libertines, The Long Blondes to The Cribs, Bloc Party to Razorlight, Arctic Monkeys to The Kooks - that erupted from all corners of Britain. These young artists exploded with attitude, tunes, vitality, and misconduct, creating an army of costumed disciples. \n\nThis is the story of the UK’s most influential musicians of this millennia, and the wild culture that surrounded them - including a collapsing music industry in the face of new media, a fatal tabloid frenzy, and the lows to be found amidst the highlife. Come and ride the UK Indie Wave, as recalled by the people who were there, sweating into their skinny jeans.\n\nEpisode 1 takes us back to Year Zero (aka 2001), when a foreign band invasion led by the Strokes ignites and inspires this nation's youth.\n\nFeatured interviewees include Johnny Borrell, Pete Doherty and The Hives\nPresented by Kate Nash\nProduced by Jack Howson & Rich Power\nA Peanut & Crumb production for BBC Sounds & 6 Music\n\nWarning: this episode contains strong language, adult themes and descriptions of drug use, which some listeners may find distressing.

But listener Guy is a diamond enthusiast, and he and his diamond-loving pals were NOT OKAY WITH THIS. He demanded we re-open the case, and here we are...\n\nSO in this glittering showdown, Dara is on a quest to flip Hannah’s perspective from “meh” to “marvelous.” And for Hannah, some uncomfortable facts soon emerge. It turns out that diamonds are much more than just overpriced bling. They're the secret ingredient in all sorts of high-tech gadgets with a whole arsenal of little-known superpowers.\n\nEnter electrochemist Julie Macpherson, who blows Hannah’s mind by showing how diamonds can slice through ice like butter, thanks to their unmatched ability to conduct heat. Not impressed yet? Physicist Mark Newton makes a diamond glow in the dark, using nothing but his phone flashlight. \n\nAnd that’s just to start! These ultra-robust gems can scrub nasty chemicals from water, serve as supercharged electrodes, and even reveal deep-earth secrets locked away for billions of years. \n\nBy the end of this episode, will Hannah finally admit diamonds are forever cool? \n\nContributors:\n\nCharlie Bexfield - Gemmologist and diamond specialist\nJulie MacPherson - Professor of Chemistry at the University of Warwick\nMark Newton - Professor of Physics at the University of Warwick\nGrahame Pearson - Professor of Earth Sciences from the University of Alberta\n\nProducer: Ilan Goodman\nExecutive Producer: Sasha Feachem\nA BBC Studios Audio Production"

The reader is Manjinder Virk.\n\nIn her new book, Arifa Akbar looks at the fearfulness invoked by murderous predators like the nineteenth century's Ripper, and of what it means to be a homeless woman when night falls. Yet, she reminds us that the night is also full of beauty and possibility. It's a time for joy and for fun, and so she takes us to London's Theatreland and to a hedonistic nightclub in Berlin, by contrast, she invites us to a convent where an order of nuns wake at the midnight to sing their elegiac prayers for the world. In Svalbard, we experience a place where night is absent and perpetual daytime proves unsettling. In sum, Wolf Moon is a reflective and thoughtful consideration of what happens after the sun has set.\n\nArifa Akbar is a theatre critic, a trustee of the Orwell Foundation and English PEN. She is currently a fellow of the London Centre for the Humanities. Her first book, is the acclaimed memoir, Consumed.\n\n\nAbridged by Katrin Williams\nProduced by Elizabeth Allard"

Another of her songs, Tom’s Diner, took on a life of its own. It’s been sampled by dozens of artists and one remix became a global hit.\n\nSuzanne recently released her tenth studio album, Flying with Angels, and will be embarking on a major tour with dates in England and Scotland later this year. \nHer mix of music includes Bartok, Rachmaninov, Philip Glass and Debussy. \n\nProducer: Clare Walker"
