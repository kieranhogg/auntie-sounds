He calls for stronger regulation and greater financial resilience among energy companies, criticising Ofgem for a lack of transparency. He argues that the current system allows \"profits to be privatised while losses are socialised\".\n\nO’Shea discusses the government’s net zero by 2030 target, describing it as “unbelievably ambitious” but necessary to drive progress in the industry. He stresses the importance of a balanced and paced transition, warning that moving too quickly could leave communities behind, as happened with the closure of coal mines in Fife. The interview explores the decline of the North Sea oil industry and its impact on Aberdeen, with O’Shea noting that the full effects on jobs have yet to be felt. He highlights Centrica’s commitment to job creation and apprenticeships, aiming to take on one apprentice every day for the next decade.\n\nDrawing on his own experience of job insecurity as a graduate, he underscores the need for careful planning and investment in skills to ensure a just transition.

They buy tickets in bulk from the original seller platform, then mark them up to fans. \n\nWe hear from a Taylor Swift super fan, who has spent hundreds on resale tickets.\n\nNow, a group of musicians including Dua Lipa, Coldplay, Sam Fender and Radiohead have sent a letter to the UK government, asking politicians to introduce a price cap on resale tickets to \"stop touts from fleecing fans”. Ireland has already introduced a law to stop people selling tickets for more than their original price. Gary Devitt, who co-founded a platform in Ireland for fan-to-fan ticket resales called Toutless, gives us his view on what effect the law has had. \n\nIn this episode we hear some stories about buying resale tickets, and ask whether price caps can actually stop the touts. The BBC’s music correspondent Mark Savage also explains how ticket touts operate, and what artists could do themselves to reduce dodgy reselling. \n\nInstagram: @bbcwhatintheworld\nEmail: whatintheworld@bbc.co.uk\nWhatsApp: +44 330 12 33 22 6\nPresenter: Hannah Gelbart\nProducers: Julia Ross-Roy, Imogen James and Maria Clara Montoya\nEditor: Verity Wilde"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0g0gjs2.jpg","duration":{"value":827,"label":"13 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"w13xtvrv","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:w13xtvrv","title":"What in the World","synopses":{"short":"Helping you make sense of what’s happening in your world.","medium":"Helping you make sense of what’s happening in your world.","long":"Helping you make sense of what’s happening in your world.

But how do they affect life under the water? That's what CrowdScience listener Alvyn wants to know, and presenter Anand Jagatia is searching beneath the waves for answers. Anand meets Professor Syamsidik who is learning about how tsuanami waves are formed to help protect against future disasters. He runs the Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Universitas Syiah Kuala, Indonesia. With him at this state-of-the-art lab is Dr David McGovern, expert in ocean and coastal modelling at London South Bank University. David tells Anand how the energy of a tsunami is spread across the entire water column. To explain the forces at play, Anand chats to Professor Emile Okal a seismologist from Northwestern University in the United States. Tsunami wave can move as fast as 800 kilometres an hour but, despite this, out at sea you might not notice it - but can the same be said for marine life? We follow the wave as it nears land and all that force is contracted and begins to show its might. Professor Suchana 'Apple' Chavanich from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand was one of the first people to swim off the Thai coast after the 2004 tsunami and remembers how coral reefs were battered.\nIn Japan, after the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami as the water retracted it pulled with it tons and tons of debris into the water. The fishing communities of the Sanriku Coast lost almost everything, their equipment was destroyed and the water was heavily polluted. Anand meets Hiroshi Sato who set up the Sanriku Volunteer Divers, a team of people who dragged the debris out of the water. One of them was diver and journalist Bonnie Waycott who tells her story of witnesses the destruction first hand and trying to rescue the fishing industry with Hiroshi. Finally, we learnt that the effect of modern tsunamis carries far further than people might have imagined. On the west coast of the United States Professor Samuel Chan is an expert in invasive species at Oregon State University. He explains how modern infrastructure is contributing to some incredible migrations.

They'll share all they know about what's keeping those big stories in and out of the news."},"activities":[]},"download":{"type":"non_drm","quality_variants":{"low":{"bitrate":128,"file_url":"https://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/https/vpid/p0mg7x5m.mp3","file_size":27000000,"label":"27 MB"},"medium":{"bitrate":128,"file_url":"https://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/https/vpid/p0mg7x5m.mp3","file_size":27000000,"label":"27 MB"},"high":{"bitrate":128,"file_url":"https://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/https/vpid/p0mg7x5m.mp3","file_size":27000000,"label":"27 MB"}}},"availability":{"from":"2025-11-12T15:55:00Z","to":null,"label":"Available for over a year"},"release":{"date":"2025-11-12T00:00:00Z","label":"12 Nov 2025"},"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"activities":[],"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=m001q6gr&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"play_context":null,"recommendation":null},{"type":"playable_item","id":"m002m90q","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:episode:m002m90r","network":{"id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","short_title":"Radio 4","logo_url":"https://sounds.files.bbci.co.uk/3.9.4/networks/bbc_radio_four/{type}_{size}.{format}","network_type":"master_brand"},"titles":{"primary":"PM","secondary":"15/11/2025","tertiary":null,"entity_title":"15/11/2025"},"synopses":{"short":"Full coverage of the day's news","medium":"Full coverage of the day's news","long":null},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0m60hlz.jpg","duration":{"value":1800,"label":"30 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qskw","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qskw","title":"PM","synopses":{"short":"Afternoon news and current affairs programme","medium":"Afternoon news and current affairs programme, reporting on breaking stories and summing up the day's headlines","long":null},"activities":[]},"download":{"type":"drm","quality_variants":{"low":{"bitrate":96,"file_url":null,"file_size":25000000,"label":"25 MB"},"medium":{"bitrate":128,"file_url":null,"file_size":33000000,"label":"33 MB"},"high":{"bitrate":320,"file_url":null,"file_size":81000000,"label":"81 MB"}}},"availability":{"from":"2025-11-15T17:30:00Z","to":"2025-12-15T17:30:00Z","label":"Available for 28 days"},"release":{"date":"2025-11-15T00:00:00Z","label":"15 Nov 2025"},"guidance":{"competition_warning":false,"warnings":null},"activities":[],"uris":[{"type":"latest","id":null,"label":"Latest","uri":"/v2/programmes/playable?container=b006qskw&sort=sequential&type=episode&experience=domestic"}],"play_context":null,"recommendation":null}],"image_url":null}]}
