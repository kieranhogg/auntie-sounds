Radio 4 is marking this with Four Sides of Seamus Heaney, four programmes each on a different aspect of his work, each with a different presenter with one thing in common - they knew the poet well.\n\nSeamus Heaney was a prolific poet but, as he said, 'lyric poetry isn't a full-time job; you wait for the surges and hope that they will come.' So, from his schooldays until his death, to keep his hand in, Heaney engaged in translation. When The Translations of Seamus Heaney was published late last year readers were amazed by its size, more than 600 pages.\n\nTheo Dorgan, poet, novelist, translator and Irish speaker surveys the range and depth of the translations and discovers these excursions into around forty languages are an interrogation of Heaney's own. Irish English is inflected by the syntax of Irish -  he translates the medieval poem Buile Shuibhne, Sweeney Astray. There is a good deal of Scots in the speech of Northern Ireland - Heaney translates the makar Robert Henryson. He takes on the founding text of English - Beowulf - and the foundations of European literature - Sophocles' Philoctetes as The Cure at Troy (interpolating the much quoted by US Presidents lines about hope and history rhyming) and Virgil's Aeneid. \n\nSeamus Heaney, like James Joyce, translated himself out of Ireland and into the wider world. He travelled, befriended and was influenced by Derek Walcott, from St Lucia, Russian exile Joseph Brodsky and Czeslaw Milosz, from Poland. \n\nTheo Dorgan hears from Marco Sonzoghni, editor of the monumental Translations, from Colm Toibin, and there are readings of his translations by the poet himself.\n\nPresenter: Theo Dorgan\nProducer: Julian May"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0g6lkqr.jpg","duration":{"value":1680,"label":"28 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"series","id":"m001pt1p","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:series:m001pt1p","title":"Four Sides of Seamus Heaney","synopses":{"short":"Series exploring different aspects of the work of Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney.","medium":"Series exploring different aspects of the work of Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney.","long":"Seamus Heaney, Nobel Prize-winner and one of the most famous, and finest, poets writing in English, died in August 2013.

BBC Radio 4 is marking this with Four Sides of Seamus Heaney, four programmes, each on a different aspect of his work, each with a different presenter with personal knowledge of the poet.\n\nGail McConnell has written about Seamus Heaney and his contemporaries and teaches at the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queen's, Belfast - the university where Heaney studied and taught. Heaney marched on Civil Rights demonstrations and lived in Belfast during the early years of The Troubles. \n\nMcConnell, whose father was murdered by the IRA in front of their family home when she was three, considers the pressures Heaney and fellow poets were under, to write for one side or another, and the courage he showed in writing about murders, punishments and the complexities of the north of Ireland. \n\nWhen the bodies of executed people in the Iron Age were found preserved in bogs in Jutland, Heaney saw a parallel with the atrocities of his own society, such as tarring and feathering, and expressed this in his collection, North. McConnell explores the ensuing controversy with novelist Colm Toibin, and poet Leontia Flynn.\n\nIn his next collection, Field Work, Heaney revealed himself as far less certain, questioning himself, his role and writing elegies with great compassion. \n\nWe hear Heaney reading some of his finest poems - Whatever You Say Say Nothing, Punishment and The Harvest Bow, which Professor Fran Brearton says is one of the great poems of the 20th century.  Rosie Lavan, co-editing Seamus Heaney's Complete Poems, and Colm Toibin, unpack his conviction of the importance, in times of trouble, of poetry.\n\nPresenter: Gail McConnell\nProducer: Julian May"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0g6lkqr.jpg","duration":{"value":1680,"label":"28 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"series","id":"m001pt1p","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:series:m001pt1p","title":"Four Sides of Seamus Heaney","synopses":{"short":"Series exploring different aspects of the work of Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney.","medium":"Series exploring different aspects of the work of Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney.","long":"Seamus Heaney, Nobel Prize-winner and one of the most famous, and finest, poets writing in English, died in August 2013.
